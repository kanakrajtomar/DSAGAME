# 📊 DSA Visualizer



---

## 🧠 Overview

**DSA Visualizer** is a web-based platform designed to **visualize Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with the help of **3D animations** powered by [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and an intuitive interface built with **React.js**.  
It aims to help learners understand complex DSA concepts through **interactive, visual learning**.
